Description:
	My project uses a machine learning algorithm called logistic regression to predict who will win the most valuable player(MVP) award in the NBA. It's made so that it can be reused every year and at any moment during a season. The 'mvp_module.py' is a class that has methods that uses the 'model' object and 'scaler' object that will easily output the results. The 'model' object saves the logistic regression and the 'scaler' object saves the way all the data will be scaled. The 'Logistic Regression' notebook is how I first created both objects.
